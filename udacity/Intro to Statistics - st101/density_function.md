# Density Function

- It is the probability for continuous spaces.
- For a continuous probability distribution, the `y-axis` represents a probability density function.
- A density function is just an `equation` to mathematically represent a continuiur distribution.
- **The `integral of the probability density function` is the probability.**
- Properties:
  - Non-negative
  - can be non-continuous (piecewise-continuous density functions)
  - density can be greater than 1
    - in case interval is small.
