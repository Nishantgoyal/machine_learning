# Software Engineering Practices

- Write Clean and modular code
  - Clean
    - readable
    - simple
    - concise
  - Modular
    - logically broken into functions and modules
- Improve Code Efficiency
  - refactoring
    - reduce workload in longer run
    - easier to maintain code
    - reuse more of your code
    - become more of a better developer
- Add Effective Documentation
- Use Version Control

## Writing Clean Code

- Use meaningful names
- Be descriptive and imply type
  - e.g., `age_list`, `is_even`, ..
- Be consistent but clearly differentiate
- Avoid abbreviations and especially single letters
- Long names != descriptive names
- Use Whitespace properly

## Writing Modular Code

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Abstract out logic to improve readability
- Minimise the number of entities
- Function should do one thing
- Arbitrary variable names can be more effective in certain functions
- Try to use fewer than three arguments in functions

## Documentation

- Clarify complex parts of code
- Navigate code easily
- Describe use and purpose of components
