# Software Engineering Practices

- Write Clean and modular code
- Improve Code Efficiency
- Add Effective Documentation
- Use Version Control
- Testing
- Logging
- Code reviews

## Testing

- Test Driven Development
  - Write tests before implementing code
  - test will fail at first, and we will know when the code is finished as the test passes
- Unit Test
  - A type of test covering a "unit" of code, usually a function
- `Python` - `pytest`

## Logging

- Valuable for understanding the events that occur while running your program.
- Process of recording messages to describe events that have occured while running your software.
- Log Messages
  - Professional and Clear
  - Concise and use capitalization
  - Choose the appropriate level for logging
    - DEBUG: level you would use for anything that happens in your program
    - ERROR: level to record any error that occurs
    - INFO: level to record all actions that are user-driven or system-specific, such as regularly scheduled operations.
  - Provide any useful information

## Code Reviews

- Catch Errors
- Ensure readability
- Check standards are met
- Share knowledge among teams
